Hi, 
You can find the first exercise (PART1) named as "exercise1.txt"
it contains my take on the subject given.

before doing any command, I would suggest to run "npm i" in order to install the required dependencies.
(In this case Jest,TS-Jest, Typescript, and Prettier (Which is a tool us))

for the second exercise (PART2), you can find the function in findLongestConsecutiveRange.ts
to execute it, you can run "npm run start"

if you want to run the test suite, I took the liberty to add your test cases and a few of my own,
To run the tests you can run "npm run test" which will allow for an easier testing of the functionnality.

then we have the third exercise (PART3)
which is also splitted in two parts

part 3.1 : you can find "eliminateDuplicates.js" file, which contains my take on the issue,
I identified the problem, showed, and added my solution, and a comment on the issue in the file.

part 3.2 : was about identifiying potential bugs in teh code:

initialCodeReplaceText.js was the inital Text Replacement code

replaceText.ts is my take on the issue,
I added comment on the file as well explaining what I have done, and my take on the issue
